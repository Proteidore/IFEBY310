### Modus operandi

Course evaluation is based on Projects {{< fa hands-holding-circle >}}

- {{< fa hand-holding-hand >}} Find a friend : all work done by *pairs of students*
- {{< fa brands github >}} Create a single *private* `GitHub` repository  for each project and each pair of students. 
- {{< fa unlock-keyhole >}} Grant me access to these repositories
- {{< fa circle-radiation >}} All work is transmitted through your private repository and nowhere else
- {{< fa paper-plane >}} No emails for project submission
- {{< fa laptop-file >}} All projects deliverables consist of `Quarto` files
- {{< fa brands html5 >}} The report should be rendered at least in HTML format, and possibly also in PDF format
- {{< fa mask >}} Do not forget to disclose your name and first name in the report
