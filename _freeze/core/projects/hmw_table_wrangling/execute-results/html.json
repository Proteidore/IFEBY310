Your working directory (working tree) should look like something like that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{.default}\n.\n├── .git/\n├── DATA/\n├──\n|   :\n├── _extensions/\n├── _outdir/\n├── _metadata.yml\n├── _quarto.yml\n├── our_report.qmd\n├── :\n└── README.md\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## {{< fa chart-bar >}} Report organization\n\nThe first part  (introduction) of the report shall be dedicated to the description of the data to be extracted and to the extraction pipeline. \n\nThe second part of the report shall be dedicated to the description of load/transform pipeline\n\nThe third part of the report  shall be dedicated  to the description of the annotation pipeline\n\nThe fourth part of the  report shall be dedicated to the stylometric analysis: which questions did you pick up (and why?), plots, summary tables  and comments. Refrain from overplaying your hand: yours plots are not likely to provide a new literary interpretation of Balzac opera. Comment the data, all the data, and nothing but the data.\n\nThe fifth part is the appendix. The first four parts should be mostly text and plots. The fifth part should be code only.\n\nThe appendix shall be dedicated to the details of the pipelines. Yu shall give the code. \n\nYou shall also give the code of the graphical pipelines in the appendix.\n\nYou shall avoid copy-paste coding. Don't Repeat Yourself. `knitr` provide the tools to organize the Quarto file so that you can write your code once and use it many times, once for data wrangling and plotting (without echoing), then for listing and explanation.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n### Organizing a report using the `jupyter` engine\n\n:::\n\n## {{< fa book >}} References\n\n- [Data Humanities with R]()\n- [Spacy]()\n- [Spark NLP]()\n- [Web scrapping]()\n- [`scrapy`]()   \n\n## {{< fa graduation-cap >}} Grading criteria\n\n\n\n| Criterion | Points  | Details |\n|:----------|:-------:|:--------|\n|Narrative, spelling and syntax | 25% | English/French {{<  fa pen-fancy >}}|\n|Plots correction | 15% | choice of `aesthetics`, `geom`, `scale` ... {{<  fa chart-area >}}|\n|Plot style | 10% | Titles, legends, labels, breaks ... {{<  fa chart-area >}} |\n|ETL  | 15% | ETL, SQL like manipulations {{<  fa database >}} |\n|Annotation |  10% | Annotations {{<  fa book >}} ||\n|Computing Statistics | 5% |  ... {{<  fa chart-area >}} |\n|DRY compliance | 20% | DRY principle at {{<  fa brands  wikipedia-w  >}} [ Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)|\n\n",
